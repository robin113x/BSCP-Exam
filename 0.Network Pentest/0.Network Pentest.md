### 🔒 WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)

- Introduced: 1997 (original Wi-Fi standard, IEEE 802.11).
- Encryption: RC4 stream cipher with 64-bit / 128-bit keys.
- Weakness: Very easy to crack due to weak key scheduling and predictable IV (Initialization Vector).
- Status: Obsolete – can be hacked in minutes with tools like Aircrack-ng.

### 🔒 WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)

- Introduced: 2003 (as a quick fix to replace WEP).
- Encryption: TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol).
- Improvement: Added per-packet key mixing + message integrity check.
- Weakness: Still vulnerable (TKIP is outdated), can be cracked with dictionary attacks.
- Status: Deprecated but still seen in old devices.

### 🔒 WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2)

- Introduced: 2004 (mandatory since 2006 for Wi-Fi certification).
- Encryption: AES-CCMP (stronger than TKIP).
- Improvement: Much more secure than WPA.
- Weakness: Vulnerable to KRACK attack (2017) if patches not applied; WPA2-Personal (PSK) can be cracked via weak passwords.
- Status: Still widely used today.

### 🔒 WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3)

- Introduced: 2018 (latest standard).
- Encryption: SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) replaces PSK.
- Improvement:
	- Strong protection against offline password-guessing.
	- Forward secrecy (session keys stay safe even if password is later known).
	- Mandatory 192-bit encryption for enterprise networks.
- Weakness: Some early implementation flaws (Dragonblood attack), but patches fixed most issues.
- Status: Most secure standard available; slowly becoming mainstream.

#### ✅ Summary:

- WEP → insecure, obsolete.
- WPA → weak, deprecated.
- WPA2 → secure if patched, still common.
- WPA3 → most secure, recommended for modern networks.

### 📡 Wi-Fi Modes in Linux / Networking

#### 🔍 Monitor Mode

**What it is:**
- A special mode where the Wi-Fi card can capture all wireless traffic in the air, even if it’s not meant for your device.

**Use cases:**
- Packet sniffing (Wireshark, tcpdump).
- Security testing (Aircrack-ng, Kismet).
- Analyzing nearby networks without connecting.

**Key point:**
- You don’t need to be connected to a network. It’s like putting your card into “listen-only” mode.
- Example command (Linux):
	```bash
	sudo iwconfig
	sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
	sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
	sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
	```

#### 🌐 Managed Mode

**What it is:**
- The default mode for Wi-Fi cards. In this mode, your Wi-Fi card communicates only with the Access Point (AP) it’s connected to.

**Use cases:**
- Normal Wi-Fi usage (browsing, streaming, etc.).
- Standard network communication.

**Key point:**
- Only processes traffic to/from your device and ignores all other packets in the air.
- Example command (Linux):
```bash
sudo iwconfig
sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode managed
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
```
