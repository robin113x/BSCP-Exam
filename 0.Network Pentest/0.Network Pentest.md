### 🔒 WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)

- Introduced: 1997 (original Wi-Fi standard, IEEE 802.11).
- Encryption: RC4 stream cipher with 64-bit / 128-bit keys.
- Weakness: Very easy to crack due to weak key scheduling and predictable IV (Initialization Vector).
- Status: Obsolete – can be hacked in minutes with tools like Aircrack-ng.

### 🔒 WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)

- Introduced: 2003 (as a quick fix to replace WEP).
- Encryption: TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol).
- Improvement: Added per-packet key mixing + message integrity check.
- Weakness: Still vulnerable (TKIP is outdated), can be cracked with dictionary attacks.
- Status: Deprecated but still seen in old devices.

### 🔒 WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2)

- Introduced: 2004 (mandatory since 2006 for Wi-Fi certification).
- Encryption: AES-CCMP (stronger than TKIP).
- Improvement: Much more secure than WPA.
- Weakness: Vulnerable to KRACK attack (2017) if patches not applied; WPA2-Personal (PSK) can be cracked via weak passwords.
- Status: Still widely used today.

### 🔒 WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3)

- Introduced: 2018 (latest standard).
- Encryption: SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) replaces PSK.
- Improvement:
	- Strong protection against offline password-guessing.
	- Forward secrecy (session keys stay safe even if password is later known).
	- Mandatory 192-bit encryption for enterprise networks.
- Weakness: Some early implementation flaws (Dragonblood attack), but patches fixed most issues.
- Status: Most secure standard available; slowly becoming mainstream.

✅ Summary:

WEP → insecure, obsolete.
WPA → weak, deprecated.

WPA2 → secure if patched, still common.

WPA3 → most secure, recommended for modern networks.
