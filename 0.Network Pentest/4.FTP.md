# FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

	- Default Port: 21
	- Used for transferring files from one host to another over a TCP-based network
	- FTP operates on a client-server model
	- **The protocol supports anonymous access, where users can log in with a common username like 'anonymous' or 'ftp', and authenticated access, where a username and password are required.**


### Connect Using FTP Command
```bash
ftp <target-ip> <target-port>  #target port is optional

ftp://username:password@X.X.X.X

lftp X.X.X.X #lftp is the enhanced version of ftp. It's easier to use than ftp.

```

### Recon

```
nmap -p 21 X.X.X.X
telnet $TARGET 21  # ctrl+]
