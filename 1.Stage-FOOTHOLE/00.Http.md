# HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) Notes
- Client-Server based	architecture
- Request‐Response model to serve Resources

## 1. Basic Netcat Example
```bash
nc example.com 80
```



## 2. HTTP Request Methods
- GET – Sends parameters in URL (e.g., ?id=1)
- POST – Sends data in the message body (e.g., form submission)
- OPTIONS – Lists supported HTTP methods for a URL
- HEAD – Like GET but returns headers only (no messagebody)
- TRACE – Echoes back client request (used fordiagnostics)
- PUT – Uploads a resource to a specific URI
- DELETE – Deletes the specified resource
- PATCH - Applies partial modifications to the resource at the specified location.
- Example with Curl:
```bash
Curl -v -X GET example.com
```
## 2.1 Response Codes
- HTTP status codes are used to tell the client the status of their request. An HTTP server can return five types of response codes:

```
|Type| 	Description|
|----|--------------|
|1xx	| Provides information and does not affect the processing of the request.|
|2xx	| Returned when a request succeeds.|
|3xx	| Returned when the server redirects the client.|
|4xx	| Signifies improper requests from the client. For example, requesting a resource that doesn't exist or requesting a bad format.|
|5xx	| Returned when there is some problem with the HTTP server itself.|
```
## 3. Authentication Bypass
- Some servers only enforce authentication on GET and POST methods but not on HEAD requests.
Example:
```bash
# GET request (requires authentication)
curl -v -X GET http://example.com/admin

# HEAD request (may bypass authentication)
curl -v -X HEAD http://example.com/admin
```


## 4. HTTP Verb Tampering

- Attackers may bypass access controls by using unexpected HTTP verbs.
- Tools:
	- Metasploit
		- scanner/http/options
		- auxiliary/scanner/http/verb_auth_bypass
	- Nmap
		- http-methods.ns
		- http-method-tamper

PoC:
```BASH
# Discover allowed HTTP methods
curl -v -X OPTIONS http://example.com/

# Attempt restricted resource access using HEAD/PUT/DELETE
curl -v -X HEAD http://example.com/admin
curl -v -X PUT http://example.com/resource
curl -v -X DELETE http://example.com/resource
```
