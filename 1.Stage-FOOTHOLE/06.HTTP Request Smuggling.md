# HTTP Request Smuggling

## 1. HTTP Request Smuggling
- A web attack where an attacker exploits differences in how front-end and back-end servers interpret HTTP requests, allowing them to “smuggle” hidden requests past security controls.

## 2. What happens in an HTTP Request Smuggling attack
- ***The attacker sends a specially crafted request that the front-end and back-end servers parse differently. This causes the back-end to process a hidden request, often leading to unauthorized actions or data theft.***
- The attacker sends one confusing request.
- Front-end server thinks:
	- “Okay, this request ends here.”
- Back-end server thinks:
	- “Wait, there’s more data after this request!”
- The extra hidden request slips through without security checks.
- The attacker can:
	- Steal someone’s session/cookies.
	- Bypass logins/firewalls.
	- Even take over the application.

## 3. How do HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise?
- HTTP/1 has two ways to say how long a request is:
	- Content-Length (tells exact size).
	- Transfer-Encoding: chunked (sends data in pieces).
- If both are used together, servers might disagree:
- Front-end trusts one.
- Back-end trusts the other.
- This miscommunication opens the door for attackers.
