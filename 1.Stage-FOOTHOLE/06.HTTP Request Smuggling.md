# HTTP Request Smuggling

## 1. HTTP Request Smuggling
- A web attack where an attacker exploits differences in how front-end and back-end servers interpret HTTP requests, allowing them to “smuggle” hidden requests past security controls.

## 2. What happens in an HTTP Request Smuggling attack

- The attacker sends one confusing request.
- Front-end server thinks:
	- “Okay, this request ends here.”
- Back-end server thinks:
- “Wait, there’s more data after this request!”
- The extra hidden request slips through without security checks.
- The attacker can:
	- Steal someone’s session/cookies.
	- Bypass logins/firewalls.
	- Even take over the application.
