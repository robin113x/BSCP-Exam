#  Insecure deserialization



## 1. Lab: Modifying serialized objects
- Log in with your normal user account.
- Check the session cookie in the /my-account request—it’s URL and Base64-encoded.
- Decode the cookie in Burp’s Inspector. You’ll see a serialized PHP object. The admin attribute is b:0 (false).
- Send the request to Repeater and change b:0 → b:1 to make yourself an admin. Apply changes.
- Send the request—you should now see a link to /admin.
- Go to /admin, and you’ll see options to delete users.
- Delete Carlos’ account by sending a request to /admin/delete?username=carlos.
