# Prototype pollution

Prototype pollution is a JavaScript security bug where an attacker injects or changes properties on Object.prototype (the base object every normal object inherits from). Because most objects inherit from that prototype, changing it can silently change app behavior and lead to serious issues — often remote code execution, data tampering, or DOM XSS in browsers.



## How it works (simple steps)
- JavaScript objects inherit from Object.prototype.
	Example: {} → inherits properties from Object.prototype.
- If an attacker can control a property name like __proto__ or constructor.prototype through user input (query strings, JSON, form fields), they can change that prototype.
After pollution, any object that checks or uses the polluted property will see the attacker-controlled value.
Example payloads:
Query-string style: /?__proto__[isAdmin]=true
JSON-like (if an app naively merges user JSON into config): {"__proto__":{"role":"admin"}}


### Lab: Client-side prototype pollution via browser APIs

- Goal: Exploit client-side prototype pollution to trigger a DOM XSS (script.src) sink.
```
Manual approach
- Find pollution source: Inject into query string /?__proto__[foo]=bar and verify Object.prototype.foo appears in the browser console.
- Identify gadget: Inspect site scripts (Sources). In searchLoggerConfigurable.js a transport_url is dynamically appended as a <script> but was made non-writable/unconfigurable with Object.defineProperty() without defining a value property — this creates a gadget that reads value.
- Exploit: Pollute prototype so the gadget picks up a value property: /?__proto__[value]=data:,alert(1); — the page renders <script src="data:,alert(1);"> and alert(1) runs, solving the lab.

DOM Invader (Burp) approach
- Load lab in Burp browser, enable DOM Invader with prototype-pollution option.
- Reload; DOM Invader finds prototype-pollution vectors in the query string.
- Click Scan for gadgets → DOM Invader locates the value gadget and the script.src sink.
- Click Exploit → DOM Invader auto-generates the POC and triggers alert(1).
- Key takeaway: Prototype pollution via __proto__ can inject properties that interact with existing DOM-creating gadgets (e.g., script insertion) to achieve DOM XSS.
