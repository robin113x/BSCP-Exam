### Lab: DOM XSS in document.write sink using source location.search

A website takes something from the URL (like a search term),
And then shows it on the page using JavaScript,Without checking if it's safe.

✅ Two Important Parts:

1. Source – Where the user input comes from
   Example: location.search → This gives the part after ? in the URL.
   For example:
```
   https://example.com/page?name=hello
   location.search → "?name=hello"
```

2. Sink – Where the data is used/executed.
   Example: document.write() → This writes HTML to the page.
   If we use it directly with location.search, it can be dangerous.



Payload  : 
```
ABC"
