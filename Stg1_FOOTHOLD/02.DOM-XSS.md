sink --> where miliscious code get exected

IN DOM : 2 main factor 
	1. source
	2. sink


A website takes something from the URL (like a search term),
And then shows it on the page using JavaScript,Without checking if it's safe.

✅ Two Important Parts:

1. Source – Where the input comes from
   Example: location.search → This gives the part after ? in the URL.
   For example:
```
   https://example.com/page?name=hello
   location.search → "?name=hello"
```
